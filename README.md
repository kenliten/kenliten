# All you need to know about me

## Bio & Dreams

My name is Otoniel Reyes, from the Dominican Republic, bornt 27 novembers ago.

I like to talk about me like this: I'm just a normal-skilled guy who love and enjoy to improve myself, I'm trying to give the whole world a huge reasons to remember throw the next 5000 years.

I'm a believer, nothing like a normal "religious guy" but yes, I believe God is the universe's author.

My bigger dream is to change the world... make big things that change in some few ways the way life is being consumed by ourselves.
